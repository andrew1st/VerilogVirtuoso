Re-Learning Verilog and Digital Design/VHDL

## What is Verilog?
Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) that is used to describe digital systems and circuits in the form of code. It was developed by Gateway Design Automation in the mid-1980s and later acquired by Cadence Design Systems.

Verilog is widely used for design and verification of digital and mixed-signal systems, including both application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). It supports a range of levels of abstraction, from structural to behavioral, and is used for both simulation-based design and synthesis-based design.

The language is used to describe digital circuits hierarchically, starting with the most basic elements such as logic gates and flip-flops and building up to more complex functional blocks and systems. It also supports a range of modeling techniques, including gate-level, RTL-level, and behavioral-level modeling.
